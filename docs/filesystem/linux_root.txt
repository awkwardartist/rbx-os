This is the Root Partition of the Initial Linux 
System. It is in Ext4 Format, and should be
4G in size (1024-byte K, 1000-byte KB notation).

Holds necessary linux data for a minimal ribbix
communications system. More data is written 
by ribbix after the communications system is 
initialized, after setup.

It is the second partition in the main system
disk, loaded in linux by the /init shell script.
It is mounted on the initial ram FS at /mnt,
and then the /init changes root with the chroot
command, to initialize the root filesystem.
