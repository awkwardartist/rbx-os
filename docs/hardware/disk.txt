script utilities for parsing disks: 


Disks are parsed "fully" after 
changing system root to mounted 
Linux FS (usually mounted at /mnt) after
basic Linux System initialization.

Each disk is assigned an accessible 
index, which refers to the disk's index
within the global "_DISK_PTRS=()" array.

a disk pointer contains all identifying 
information for accessing the disk.
