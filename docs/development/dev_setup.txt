How to create a basic Development
Environment on a Linux host:

1.) Create an OS source directory, this
    will be called "$SRC" for the duration
    of this document.

2.) Clone this repository (awkwardartist/rbx-os)
    into $SRC/repo. This is where the repo
    will be stored.

3.) Create an assets directory, at path
    $SRC/assets, then populate it with
    the shell generation utility at
    $SRC/repo/ribbix/build/scripts/assets.sh ASSET_PATH
