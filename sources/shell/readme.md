# Ribbix Scripting
the designed scripting language(s) for the
Ribbix Kernel.

# System Script
Used specifically by the kernel internally 
and as input for kernel/userspace interaction.

## Design
A low-level but dynamic language which can be used in miltiple scopes (like in userspace and the kernel) without core language modification.

# Ribbix Shell
Used as the system-wide shell, kind of like Bash for Linux or CMD for Windows.
## Design
Supposed to be as basic as possible, but flexible enough to be used for userspace scripting.
